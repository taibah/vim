# vim
So I've been using VIM as my primary editor as far as I can remember. Over the years I got comfortable with plugin choices I always used to improve the editor to fit my needs. Recently, I pumped into *neovim* and though it actually seems to offer nice improvements and it does utilize Lua as backend scripting language instead of the dated vimsScript ... So I've decided to give it a try and this repo will be used to document my customizations for it. Please feel free to copy, use as you see fit within the boundries of the MIT licesnse.    

## Environment 
This will be deployed on a Rocky Linux 9 system with EPEL enabled.
